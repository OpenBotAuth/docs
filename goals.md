# Goals

#### Origin Enforcement

Enable websites to verify and block bots at the origin server level, without relying solely on edge or proxy-based filtering.

#### Intent Declaration

Allow origin to selectively reveal or hide content based on bot's intent, ie, to train LLM models,  for search indexing or summarization, etc.&#x20;

#### Open registry

An open bot registry tied to other online identities, such that anyone can create a verified identity without an intermediary.
