# Goals

1. **Origin enforcement :** Enable websites to verify and block bots at the origin server level, without relying solely on edge or proxy-based filtering.
2. **Intent based auth:** Allow origin to selectively reveal or hide content based on bot's intent.
3. **Open registry:** Build an open bot registry tied to other online identities, such that anyone can create a verified identity without an intermediary.
