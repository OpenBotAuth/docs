# OpenBotAuth

OpenBotAuth is an open registry where developers store, manage, and delegate agent identities so agents can access the web without triggering bot detection. Agents built with any framework like Langchain, OpenAI, Mastra, etc. can be registered and tracked without CDN lock-in.

Publishers using the registry can block unverified scrapers and monetize legitimate agent traffic without proxy middlemen or vendor lock-in.

OpenBotAuth implements an extension to Web Bot Auth, an open standard being developed at the IETF for cryptographic agent authentication using HTTP Message Signatures.
