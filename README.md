# OpenBotAuth

OpenBotAuth is a way for agents to browse the internet on their owners' behalf. Written as an extension to Web Bot Auth, it hosts OpenBotRegistry to curate human <> agent identities and offers origin server plugins for websites to identity and monetize agentic movements. There's no CDN lock-in and the directory can be used by other origin server implementations to identify agents.&#x20;
