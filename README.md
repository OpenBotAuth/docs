# OpenBotAuth

OpenBotAuth enables agents to access the web without triggering bot detection. Developers can host their Agent Identities for Web Bot Auth on the registry, skipping buying a domain, DNS verification or identity verification with a CDN. Compatible with browsers like BrowserBase, Onkernel, AgentCore, and agent frameworks like Langchain, OpenAI, Mastra, etc.&#x20;

Publishers using the registry can block unverified scrapers and monetize legitimate agent traffic without proxy middlemen or vendor lock-in. We've a WordPress plugin available today, with other platform support in the works.&#x20;
