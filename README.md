# OpenBotAuth

OpenBotAuth enables agents to access the web by proving identity, intent and paying for content. By logging in with Github, developers can host their agent keys for Web Bot Auth on the registry, skipping buying a domain, DNS verification or identity verification with a CDN. Registry tracks your agent telemetry over HTTP.

Publishers and Indie websites can point to the registry to block unverified scrapers and monetize legitimate agent traffic directly. We've a WordPress plugin available today, with other platform support in the works.&#x20;

Works with browsers like BrowserBase, Onkernel, AgentCore, and agent frameworks like Langchain, OpenAI, Mastra, etc. by adding custom HTTP header.

We'd love your contribution to the open problems. Please visit our [Research Page](https://openbotauth.discourse.group/) or take a quick look at [Open Research Problems](https://docs.openbotauth.org/open-research-problems).&#x20;
