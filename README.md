# OpenBotAuth

OpenBotAuth is a CDN-agnostic origin server that provides access control and payment rails for websites to monetize authenticated bots and agents. Rather than relying on proprietary fingerprinting or centralized verification services, OpenBotAuth creates an open ecosystem where any bot adhering to Web Bot Auth can prove its identity, and any website can verify credentials and collect payments at the edge or origin.
