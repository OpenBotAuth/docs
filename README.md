# OpenBotAuth

OpenBotAuth is a CDN-agnostic origin server that provides intent-based authorization and pricing infra for websites to monetize authenticated bots and agents. By installing directly on your origin rather than proxying through cached subdomains, OpenBotAuth enables real-time dynamic scoping, based on each bot's declared intent, in runtime.

We'd love your contribution to the open problems. Please visit our [Research Page](https://openbotauth.discourse.group/) or take a quick look at [Open Research Problems](https://docs.openbotauth.org/open-research-problems).&#x20;
