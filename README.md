# OpenBotAuth

OpenBotAuth (pronounced Open Bot Auth) provides an <mark style="color:$warning;">open</mark>, cryptographically-verifiable framework that allows agents to prove their authorization without a CDN lock-in. This specification defines how bots/agents can present signed credentials, how services can verify these credentials at the edge or origin, and how authorization scopes can be dynamically enforced through WASM-based policies. By establishing an open standard, OpenBotAuth enables interoperability across agent platforms, gives developers control over their authentication infrastructure, and allows services to make informed decisions about automated traffic without relying on proprietary fingerprinting or centralized verification services.
