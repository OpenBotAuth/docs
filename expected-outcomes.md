# Expected Outcomes

#### Non-Spoofable Identity

The specification must provide non-repudiable proof of bot identity and actions, creating a verifiable record that can serve as legal evidence when disputes arise.

#### No Discrimination

Bots and agents from large corporations shouldn't receive preferential access or rates over smaller organisations.

#### Private Browsing

Internet was built on the backbone of privacy and we don't want a future where private lanes don't exists. There must be reasonable rate limites to accomodate anonymous bot traffic.&#x20;

#### Open Registry Verification

No single entity should monopolize bot authentication and blocking decisions, ensuring the system remains open and resistant to centralized control.

#### Runtime Attenuation

Origin can dynamically adjust bot permissions during an active session—restricting or expanding access in real-time based on observed behavior, declared intent, and current context without forcing re-authentication.
