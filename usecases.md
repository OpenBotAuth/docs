# Usecases

### Publishers and Bloggers

**The new AdSense of the AI era.** A blogger posting about their Eurotrip should be able to earn their fair share from LLMs—granting full-text access to verified agents who agree to licensing terms while blocking or rate-limiting unauthorized scrapers. With OpenBotAuth, content creators can finally track who accesses their work, enforce usage rights, and build monetization models around legitimate AI agent access.

### E-commerce

Amazon probably does not want Walmart agents on their website. However, crawling is a major use case in e-commerce to offer competitive pricing to users. We want a world where Google agents do not see different pricing than Amazon agents. OpenBotAuth enables transparent, verifiable agent identity so competitive price monitoring happens on equal terms—no preferential treatment based on corporate partnerships, just authenticated access with clear intent declaration.

### Travel

Travel booking agents verify their identity to search flights, hotels, and rental cars across multiple providers. OpenBotAuth enables travel sites to offer preferential API-like access to authenticated agents while protecting against price scraping and inventory hoarding by malicious bots.

### Investment

Financial research agents prove their identity to access market data, company filings, and analyst reports. Investment platforms can ensure compliance by tracking which agents access sensitive data and for what declared purpose (research vs training).

### Human Trafficking Prevention

Law enforcement and NGO agents verify their credentials to access sensitive case databases and cross-reference victim information across jurisdictions. OpenBotAuth provides non-repudiable identity proof suitable for legal evidence while protecting database access from unauthorized actors.

### Public Health Research

Epidemiological research agents authenticate to access COVID tracking data, hospitalization rates, and vaccination statistics. Health agencies can grant verified researchers full dataset access while limiting anonymous access to protect patient privacy.

### Content Moderation

Platform safety agents authenticate to scan for harmful content, copyright violations, and policy breaches. Content platforms can grant verified moderation bots elevated access to private user data while maintaining strict controls on unverified automated access.
