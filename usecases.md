# Usecases

### Beloved E-Commerce

Amazon probably does not want Walmart agents on their website. We envision a world where Google agents do not see different pricing than Amazon agents. Recently, [Shopify](https://chrisleverseo.com/blog/how-to-fix-shopify-crawl-issues-in-screaming-frog-and-sitebulb-using-web-bot-auth/) released an independent implementation of Web Bot Auth to whitelist their SEO crawlers. The ability to allow specific users in a fast lane so they don't hit 429 error is powerful for merchants.&#x20;

### Publishers and Bloggers

As a blogger, I'm happy to get crawlers on my website, as it boosts visibility. However, the only thing that worked for bloggers is Google Adsense and now with deteriorating web traffic, a blogger posting about their eurotrip should be able to earn their fair share from LLMs. With OpenBotAuth, content creators can finally track who accesses their work, enforce usage rights, and build monetization models around legitimate AI agent access.

### Financial Services

Another heavy user of AI products. This industry has a lot of legal requirements around authenticated data sources. Furthermore, they want ot know if the client connecting to the servers is compliant and follow specific standards. This can be solved with a whitelisted registry for financial markets in the OpenBotRegistry directly.&#x20;

### Agentic Login

Agents often get stuck on login pages, as those were made for the human. As less and less traffic gets redirected to websites, we need new ways to authenticate users of the web.

### Travel

Travel booking agents verify their identity to search flights, hotels, and rental cars across multiple providers. OpenBotAuth enables travel sites to offer preferential API-like access to authenticated agents while protecting against price scraping and inventory hoarding by malicious bots.

### Human Trafficking Prevention

Law enforcement and NGO agents verify their credentials to access sensitive case databases and cross-reference victim information across jurisdictions. OpenBotAuth provides non-repudiable identity proof suitable for legal evidence while protecting database access from unauthorized actors.

### Public Health Research

Epidemiological research agents authenticate to access COVID tracking data, hospitalization rates, and vaccination statistics. Health agencies can grant verified researchers full dataset access while limiting anonymous access to protect patient privacy.

### Content Moderation

Platform safety agents authenticate to scan for harmful content, copyright violations, and policy breaches. Content platforms can grant verified moderation bots elevated access to private user data while maintaining strict controls on unverified automated access.
